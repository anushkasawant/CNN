# CNN 

Predicting the category of footwear (Boots, Sandals, or Slippers) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) involves training a model that can differentiate between the unique features of each type of footwear. Here's a general outline of the steps involved in building such a model:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset of images containing Boots, Sandals, and Slippers. It's important to ensure that the images are of good quality and that each class has a balanced number of images.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size, converting them to grayscale or RGB format, and normalizing the pixel values.

Model Architecture: Design a CNN architecture that consists of several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The exact architecture will depend on the complexity of the dataset and the size of the images.

Model Training: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed images. Use a loss function like categorical cross-entropy, and optimize the model using stochastic gradient descent or a similar algorithm. The number of epochs and batch size should be chosen based on the size of the dataset and the available computational resources.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the category of new images of footwear.

Overall, building a CNN model for predicting the category of footwear involves a combination of data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and prediction.
